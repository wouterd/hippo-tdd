======================

- Please do NOT read ahead, go for one assignment at a time. Do not write your solution based on what is coming.
- Keep your solutions in the java code, don't worry about the JSP. If you want, you can implement the JSP as well if you
  want to see your solution work. This is about writing code and test code and learning mocking.
- HINT: Mockito allows you to mock a class/interface and pass it to a component without setting anything up. It will
  stub any void methods by always just returning immediately and it will return null on not implemented methods. It will
  record method calls though, which means you can pass a mocked response to a doBeforeRender() and check which
  setAttribute() calls were made.

1. Add a component so that the right column of a news deatil page shows a related news document. It's only possible
to relate one news document. You probably also have to adjust the hippo bean.

2. The user wants to be able to relate more than one news document. Add support for this feature.

3. Make sure that there isn't more than 5 related newsdocuments shown. If there are more than 5 related news documents,
just show the first 5.

4. Order the related news documents on their publication date. The newest news document should be shown first.

5. News items can have a bunch of keywords. The right column should show a list of "similiar" news items based on the
keywords. Maximum of 10 similiar news items.

6. There should be a seperate list per keyword of related news items by keyword.
